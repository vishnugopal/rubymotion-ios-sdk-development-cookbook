## Description

A Rubymotion example Cookbook app. There are several views and quite many controllers so you can see how everything is hooked up.

You can learn about:
  
  * How to hook up storyboards in Interface Builder (see resources/Storyboard.storyboard) from Rubymotion
  * Work with segues using prepareForSegue:
  * Multiple segues from a table view controller depending on whether it's in edit mode or not.
  * Hook up a navigation view controller to your normal controllers

This pretty much replicates everything from the iOS SDK Development book by Pragmatic Programmers (until about page 415) and I'll keep updating this as I go through the book.
